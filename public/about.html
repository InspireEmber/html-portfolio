<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Tirth Sutariya, and I am currently a student at Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology (SVNIT), located in Surat. I am passionate about technology and aim to further my expertise by pursuing M.Tech in the future.</p>
<p>As a budding software developer, I have acquired proficiency in programming languages such as C/C++ and HTML, and I am continually expanding my knowledge in various tech domains. My academic focus aligns with my goal to build cutting-edge projects that can contribute meaningfully to the tech industry.</p>
<p>Outside of my academic pursuits, I have a strong interest in painting, classical music, and writingâ€”activities that help me maintain a well-rounded and creative approach to problem-solving. I believe these passions allow me to think outside the box and bring a unique perspective to my projects.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, I have two main goals:</p>
<ol>
  <li>To secure at least two internships in the technology field to gain hands-on experience.</li>
  <li>To develop and build innovative projects that demonstrate my skills and contribute to my growth as a software engineer.</li>
</ol>
<p>I am always eager to learn, collaborate, and explore new opportunities in the ever-evolving world of technology.</p>
